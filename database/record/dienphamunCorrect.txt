     once upon a a time there lived a a poor girl ella whose parents seemed very unkind to her   girl ella whose seemed    lived whose  made do chores helping hang  end  ella   their  we'll  day only six  worse  ella  dress-up  his dress princesses   find dress-up had grown   ella  for  ella with buttons and sparkles train  ella looked in in her her mummy's wardrobe but there there was nothing in in there there that she thought would make her her look like a princess  then she she looked in in daddy's wardrobe wardrobe thinking she she might dress up as a prince but there was nothing in in his wardrobe wardrobe either.  ella looked in her big sister's wardrobe  get out they they cried when they they saw her  you'll make a mess  ella thought that if she she did not not have a dress-up costume to to to wear to to to the the party party she she could not not go to to to the the party party at all  she ran to the garden and climbed into her favourite tree  then she cried a little bit  right at that moment something special happened  the the the dog who lived in the the the house behind popped his head up over the the the fence  he he was was standing on his hind legs and smiling because he he was was a fairy prince although ella didn't know it yet  why are you crying he asked ella  i'm crying because i don't have a fancy dress costume to to wear to to tom's party ella sniffed

upon a a time there lived a a poor girl ella whose parents seemed very unkind to her  they made her her do chores around the the the house like helping to wash the the the dishes hang and and fold the the the clothes and and playing with her her baby brother  even though she had had two older sisters who also had had to help it seemed like the work would never end  when ella would complain about the work she had to do her parents did not understand at all  we live in a house together they would tell her  everyone has to to do their little bit to to help  if you you you don't help it will take us so long to to to clean up after everyone that we'll have no time left over to to to read to to to you you you or or play with you you you or or do nice things together  so ella was was stuck with doing some chores every day even though she was was only six  worse her baby brother would come along and make mess of everything right after she had cleaned up  one day ella received an invitation in the mail  it was for a dress-up party at her friend tom's house  tom wanted everyone at his party to dress up like princes and princesses  ella was very excited  but when she she she went to to her her toy box to to find her her dress-up princess dress she she she saw that she she she had grown out of it  a long long long long time ago  ella needed a new dress  but mummy and daddy didn't have any money for a new dress  not the the kind that ella would like with pearl buttons and sparkles on the the train  ella looked in in her her mummy's wardrobe but there there was nothing in in there there that she thought would make her her look like a princess  then she she looked in in daddy's wardrobe wardrobe thinking she she might dress up as a prince but there was nothing in in his wardrobe wardrobe either.  ella looked in her big sister's wardrobe  get out they they cried when they they saw her  you'll make a mess  ella thought that if she she did not not have a dress-up costume to to to wear to to to the the party party she she could not not go to to to the the party party at all  she ran to the garden and climbed into her favourite tree  then she cried a little bit  right at that moment something special happened  the the the dog who lived in the the the house behind popped his head up over the the the fence  he he was was standing on his hind legs and smiling because he he was was a fairy prince although ella didn't know it yet  why are you crying he asked ella  i'm crying because i don't have a fancy dress costume to to wear to to tom's party ella sniffed sadly  i need

fairy dogmother)  we can fix that quick as you like  find me an old ball some some gloves a a scarf a a newspaper and some some crayons  i'll sort out the rest with a magic spell   so ella went inside and found those things  when she came back out the the dog jumped over the the fence and did his magic  ella looked beautiful  what did you ask for the ball  just to play with it  she went to the party and danced all day  nobody would have recognised her her if it wasn't for the enormous smile that she wore on her her face  it was one of of the best days of of her life   later when she came home the newspaper scarf and gloves became ordinary again  she put them neatly away  having a dress from the shop would have been nice  but having a a a dress with a a a bit of magic in it was ten times better and made her a a a princess for real       once upon a a time there lived a a poor girl ella whose parents seemed very unkind to her  they made her her do chores around the the the house
